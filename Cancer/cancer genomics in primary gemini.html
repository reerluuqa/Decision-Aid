                <li><strong>Family history is your key tool.</strong> Use it to assess a patient's risk of inherited cancer predisposition.</li>
                <li>Around <strong>5% of cancers have an inherited basis</strong>. While not common, early identification can be life-saving for families.</li>
                <li>Your role is to <strong>identify patients at higher-than-population risk</strong> and refer them appropriately.</li>

            <h3>Key Terminology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genomics:</strong> The study of the entire set of DNA (the genome).</li>
                <li><strong>Variant:</strong> A change in the DNA sequence. This term is now preferred over "mutation".</li>
                <li><strong>Germline Variant:</strong> An inherited genetic change present in all cells of the body. These can be passed on to children.</li>
                <li><strong>Somatic Variant:</strong> A genetic change that occurs after conception and is confined to a specific tissue, like a tumour. These are not inherited.</li>
                <li><strong>Precision Medicine:</strong> Tailoring treatment based on an individual's genetic makeup, environment, and lifestyle.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When to Suspect an Inherited Cancer Risk</h3>
            <p>A helpful rule of thumb for referral consideration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Two relatives</strong> on the same side of the family diagnosed with the same or related cancer under the age of 60.</li>
                <li><strong>Three relatives</strong> on the same side of the family diagnosed at any age.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other red flags include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cancer diagnosed at a young age (e.g., bowel cancer at 35).</li>
                <li>Multiple primary cancers in one person.</li>
                <li>Specific combinations of cancers in a family (e.g., breast and ovarian).</li>
                <li>Known genetic variant in the family (e.g., BRCA, Lynch syndrome).</li>
                <li>Certain ethnicities, such as Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, have a higher prevalence of BRCA variants.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="lynch-syndrome flex-item">
            <h3>Spotlight on Lynch Syndrome</h3>
            <p>Lynch syndrome is a common inherited condition that increases the risk of several cancers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Associated Cancers:</strong> Bowel, endometrial, ovarian, gastric, and others.</li>
                <li><strong>Action in Primary Care:</strong> If a patient is diagnosed with bowel or endometrial cancer, they should now be automatically tested for Lynch syndrome in secondary care.</li>
                <li><strong>Your Role:</strong> For a patient diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, focus on holistic care, including symptom vigilance, risk-reducing measures (like aspirin), and discussing implications for family members.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="brca flex-item">
            <h3>Understanding BRCA1 and BRCA2</h3>
            <p>BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that, when altered, increase the risk of several cancers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Associated Cancers in Women:</strong> Significantly increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Associated Cancers in Men:</strong> Increased risk of male breast cancer and prostate cancer. There is also a link to pancreatic cancer for both sexes.</li>
                <li><strong>Management:</strong> Individuals with a BRCA variant may be eligible for enhanced screening (e.g., earlier mammograms, PSA testing from age 40) and risk-reducing surgeries.</li>

                <h3>Making a Referral to Clinical Genetics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you suspect a hereditary cancer syndrome, refer the patient to your local clinical genetics service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advice & Guidance:</strong> If you are unsure about whether to refer, use local advice and guidance services. Provide as much detail as possible about the family history, including types of cancer and ages at diagnosis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing the Right Person:</strong> Ideally, the first person in a family to be tested should be someone who has had cancer. If an unaffected patient is concerned, encourage them to speak to their affected relative about seeking a referral.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="practical-tips flex-item">
                <h3>Actionable Tips for Your Practice</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Always Ask About Family History:</strong> When a patient presents with potential cancer symptoms, a family history can be a crucial part of your risk assessment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Code It:</strong> Where possible, code significant family history in the patient's record.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remember Paternal History:</strong> Inherited risk can come from the father's side of the family as well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Direct-to-Consumer Tests:</strong> If a patient brings you results from a home testing kit, advise them to seek more information from the provider. Manage the patient based on their family history and clinical picture, following standard NHS referral pathways.</li>
                    <li><strong>Family History Changes:</strong> Advise patients to inform you if their family history of cancer changes, as this may alter their risk assessment.</li>
